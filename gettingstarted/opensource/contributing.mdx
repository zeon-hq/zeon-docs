We value your interest in making a contribution to Zeon. We are very grateful for each and every contribution. If you're unsure about how to begin, don't worry. This guide should provide some further information on how to proceed, but we don't want a mountain of restrictions that block your participation.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports to pull requests and everything in between. We also welcome contributions to our documentation, which is hosted on GitHub. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VAtmzWZQAr). We're happy to help!

## How to contribute

We have written an developer section on how to contribute to the project. You can read it [here](/gettingstarted/devnotes/workflow).
