The goal of this project is to provide you with the choice, freedom, and cost-effectiveness to host and manage your own enterprise solution as you see fit. 

We can't wait to see what you create with Zeon!

## Why Self Host?

- **Cost**: Self hosting is free, and you can host Zeon on your own hardware or on a cloud provider of your choice.
- **Privacy**: Self hosting means that you have full control over your data and how it is stored.
- **Customization**: Self hosting allows you to customize Zeon to your needs, and you can even contribute to the project if you want to.
