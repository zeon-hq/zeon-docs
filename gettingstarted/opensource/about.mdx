## Why Open Source?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

### Security

Open source software is more secure than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. And because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source software without asking for permission from original authors, they can fix, update, and upgrade open source software more quickly than they can proprietary software.

### Own Your Data

Zeon is a self-hosted platform. This means that you can host it on your own server and have full control over your data. You can also choose to host it on our servers. We will never sell your data to third parties. 

We will never use your data for advertising or for any purpose other than to provide you with the best experience possible. We will never share your data with anyone else without your permission.

### Customization

Open source software can be customized to fit your needs. Unlike proprietary software, open source software can be modified and customized to fit your needs. If you need to customize the software to fit your needs, you can do so without having to ask for permission from the original authors.
