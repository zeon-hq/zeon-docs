## What is a Workspace

A workspace is a collection of Zeon modules that you manage together. In general, a workspace is the smallest unit that you can work with in Zeon. You can create multiple workspaces for different projects or teams within your organization. You can also use workspaces to control access to your Zeon resources. 

For example, you can grant access to a workspace to a specific user or group of users, and then only those users can access the resources in that workspace. You can further control access to resources in a workspace by using roles. 

## What is a Role

A role is a collection of permissions that you grant to a user. Permissions determine what actions a user can perform on a resource. For example, you can grant a user permission to create a module in a workspace, or you can grant a user permission to view a module in a workspace.

Available Roles:
1. **Owner** - The owner of a workspace has full access to all resources in the workspace. The owner can also manage access to the workspace and its resources. Has access to and manage billing.
2. **Admin** - The admin of a workspace has full access to all resources in the workspace. The admin can also manage access to the workspace and its resources.
3. **Chat Agent** - The chat agent of a workspace has read-write access to resources granted permission to in the chat module. The viewer cannot manage access to the workspace and its resources.
