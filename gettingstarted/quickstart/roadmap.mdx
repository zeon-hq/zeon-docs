We continously work on improving Zeon and adding new features. Our [Roadmap](https://zeon.ducalis.io/ducalis-roadmap/) gives you an overview of what we are currently working on and what we are planning to work on in the future.

We will always monitor and track feature requests from all channels and document them in our roadmap as a unified reference for everyone. This roadmap also links to the GitHub issues that are tracking the feature requests.
