# Auto Responder

The auto responder is a feature that allows you to send automatic messages to your visitors when they start a conversation with you. You can use it to greet your visitors, let them know that you are not available at the moment, or to ask them to leave their contact information.

You can configure the auto responder in the behaviour tab section of the channel settings.
