# Operating Hours

Operating hours are the hours during which your chat widget is available to your customers. Outside of these hours, your chat widget will show an offline indicator but your customers will **still be able** to start a new conversation.

## Setting your timezone

You can set your timezone by selecting your timezone from the dropdown menu.
